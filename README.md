Homepage: [http://www.jonsuh.com/jsbible](www.jonsuh.com/jsbible)

## Getting started

This widget uses [Logos Bible Software](http://www.logos.com)'s [Biblia.com Bible API](http://api.biblia.com) service, which requires a unique API for your website, to get the Bible text. You'll need to [register for a free Logos account](https://www.logos.com/register) if you don't have one already. Because this plugin uses Biblia's API service, by using this plugin you are agreeing to [Biblia API's Terms of Service](http://api.biblia.com/docs/Terms_of_Use).

1.  Sign in at [api.biblia.com](http://api.biblia.com/v1/Users/SignIn) with your Logos account.
2.  Register a new application (in this case, your website).
3.  Keep record of your API key.

Don't forget that this plugin requires jQuery.

## Usage

Usage is easy and straight forward.

<pre>$(document).ready(function(){
  $(".jsbible").jsbible({
    api: "your-unique-api-key"
  });
});</pre>

Customizable options are also available.

<pre>$(".jsbible").jsbible({
  api: "apikey",                   // Your unique API key from api.biblia.com
  version: "kjv",                  // Bible versions. Supports: KJV, ASV, AV
  red_letter: true,                // Red letter text
  persistent_chapter: false,       // Chapter number reset on book change
  scrolltop: true,                 // Scroll-to-top button
  scrolltop_text: "Back to Top",   // Text for scroll-to-top button
  scrolltop_speed: 250             // Speed of scroll-to-top animation in milliseconds
});</pre>
